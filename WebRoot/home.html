Instead of starting and ending at Caffe Prada, as usual, riders will start and end at <b>Wake Forest University</b>, with a gelato stop at Caffe Prada along the way. Riders will join Wake students, faculty and staff  to help raise awareness of biking among the WFU community and to draw attention to the need for improved bicycle and pedestrian corridors between WFU and downtown Winston-Salem.

The slow-paced, ten-mile ride is open to all. 3 to 5:30 p.m., starting at the ZSR Library on the WFU campus.
