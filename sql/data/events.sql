	N'This week''s Community Bike Ride will be backwards, sort of. Instead of starting and ending at Caffe Prada, as usual, riders will start and end at Wake Forest University, with a gelato stop at Caffe Prada along the way. Riders will join Wake students, faculty and staff to help raise awareness of biking among the WFU community and to draw attention to the need for improved bicycle and pedestrian corridors between WFU and downtown Winston-Salem. The first 25 to sign up will get an official WS Greenways water bottle, and everyone gets a free gelato. The slow-paced, ten-mile ride is open to all. Sign up <a href="http://pdc.wfu.edu/event/5584/">here</a>. Co-sponsored by the WFU Institute for Public Engagement.'),
