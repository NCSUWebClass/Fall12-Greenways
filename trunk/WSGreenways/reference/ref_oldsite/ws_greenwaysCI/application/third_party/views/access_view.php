  <p>Greenways can be an excellent way for those with reduced mobility or other limiting circumstances to move around outdoors. Most paths have relatively flat, paved surfaces suitable for wheelchairs, scooters and strollers. The trails allow access to the edges of woods and open fields, landscapes that would otherwise be off-limits to many. </p>
                    <p>Not all of Winston-Salem's greenways are equally accessible, however. Some have hills; others have unsatisfactory parking; some even have steps. The Salem Lake Greenway is unpaved, and the Downtown Strollway has a gravel surface. </p>

<p>Here are some of the more accessible trails and tips on reaching them:</p>
                
                        <ol>
                        				<li><strong>Bethabara Greenway, Monarcas Creek section </strong>– This popular and beautiful wooded path, behind the historic buildings, gardens and ruins of Historic Bethabara, can be reached from an entrance at the end of Indiana Boulevard Ext., off Bethabara Road beside Bethabara Moravian Church. Greenway users have the generous permission of Bethabara Moravian to park in their lot. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Bethabara Greenway, Mill Creek section </strong>– This short but lovely stretch of well-paved greenway is not easy to find. One end, at Reynolda Rd., is reached by an uphill hike to a set of wooden steps. A more accessible entrance is at the end of Midkiff Rd. (off Reynolda, past Old Town Dr.), where you can park on the street. There is a bit of hill and some rough ground around the barricade, but after that it's smooth going. Two picturesque bridges cross the creek; the second leads to the uneven boardwalk in the marsh nearby. There are several benches.</li>
                                          
                                        <li><strong>Muddy Creek Greenway</strong> – The city's most popular greenway is also among its most accessible. Handicapped parking is available in the lot off Meadowlark Dr. Pavement is particularly smooth, and there are a few benches along the way. </li>
                                        <li><strong>Newell-Massey Greenway</strong> – This long, flat and smooth trail is accessible only from Motor Road. There is currently no parking at the Old Greensboro Road entrance. </li>
                                        
                                        <li><strong>Salem Creek Greenway, Civitan Park area</strong> – This a flat and smooth stretch of an otherwise hilly greenway. With a handicapped placard you can park for free behind WSSU's Anderson Center (at the end of the parking lot that begins where Reynolds Park Dr. dead-ends into  Martin Luther King Dr.) Take the sloping bridge over Salem Creek to the trail.</li>
                                        
                                        <li><strong>Silas Creek Greenway </strong>– The steep street-crossing from the parking lot on Yorkshire Rd. can be avoided. Drive to the end of Burkeshore Rd. (off Shoreland Rd. between Yorkshire and Robinhood) and park on the street.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Strollway </strong>– From Second Street south, this is an easy and lovely downhill ride. The decline just after First Street may be a bit steep for some to undertake without assistance.</li>
                            
                            </ol>
