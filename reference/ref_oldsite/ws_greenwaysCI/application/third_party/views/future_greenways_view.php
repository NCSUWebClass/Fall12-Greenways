                   <p>When the Winston-Salem City Council unanimously approved funds for the Brushy Fork Greenway at a recent meeting, they paved the way for a significant new link in our expanding network of pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly trails. It's a happy development in an epic fourteen-year tangle with red tape.</p>
						<p>This 1.3â€“mile stretch will run from the Newell-Massey Greenway to a connector with Salem Creek Greenway. It will begin at Skyland Park, at Old Greensboro Road and East Fifth Street, and end at Lowery Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. In the process, it will run under Fifth Street, under Business 40, under a Norfolk Southern Railway line, and under an old, out-of-use street bridge. </p> 
						<p>"The incredible bureaucratic complications of getting the railroad and the various other agencies that have to approve that area are mind bogling," Dan Besse told the Winston-Salem Journal.  Besse, an untiring advocate for greenways, is the city council member who has pushed this project along for more than a decade.</p>
						<p>Approval for the project involved FEMA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and the N.C. Department of Transportation. City staff had to get 52 different signatures at Norfolk Southern just to get permission to survey the land along the path.</p>
						<p>But when completed, Brushy Fork's 1.3 miles will bring together more than 14 miles of virtually contiguous greenway. "This is a developing network of off-street trails," says Matthew Burczyk, the city's bicycle and pedestrian coordinator. "That's really the model we want to use for the entire greenway system." </p>
