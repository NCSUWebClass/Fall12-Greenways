                    	<p>WS Greenways is a citizen advocacy group working to get more people onto the  greenways found throughout Winston-Salem and Forsyth County. We are also dedicated to the timely improvement and expansion of our greenway system. Our goal is a community-wide network of trails connecting destinations for work, play, school, shopping and more.</p>

                  <p>Greenways offer opportunities for recreation and exercise by providing safe, accessible routes for cyclists, joggers, strollers, skaters, scooters, people in wheelchairs, dog walkers, bird watchers, kids and adults, families and friendsâ€”in short, everyone and anyone.</p>
                                    <p>Greenways improve environmental quality by protecting plant and animal habitat. They help clean our water and air. And they bring us to increasingly hard-to-find natural areas close to home.</p>
            
                                    <p>Greenways can facilitate alternative transportation by providing bicycle- and pedestrian-friendly routes between home, work and other destinations. By encouraging non-automotive options, greenways reduce automobile congestion and pollution, thus improving the quality of life in our city.</p> 
            
                                    <p>Greenways make our community more attractive to all its residents, as well as to businesses hoping to lure high-quality employers from elsewhere, and to businesses considering an expansion or relocation  here.</p>
