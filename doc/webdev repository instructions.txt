1) Install Eclipse EE
	1) I use the version at http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/junosr1, but other versions might work.
2) Install Subclipse
	1) Open Eclipse
	2) Help -> Install New Software
	3) http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.8.x
	4) Check Subclipse
	5) Install (agree to license, etc.)
	6) Restart Eclipse
3) Install PHP plugin
	1) Help -> Install New Software
	2) http://download.eclipse.org/tools/pdt/updates/release
	4) Check PDT Development Tools
	5) Open Uncategorized and check PHP...SDK...
	6) Install
	7) Restart Eclipse
4) Setup repository location
	1) Window -> Open Perspective -> Other -> SVN Repository Exploring
	2) Under SVN Repositories at the top-left, Right-click -> New -> Repository Location
	3) Enter https://github.com/NCSUWebClass/Fall12-Greenways.git
	4) Finish
5) Checkout repository
	1) Open SVN Repository perspective.
	2) Under SVN Repositories, open ...github...Fall12-Greenways.git
	3) Right-click on trunk
	4) Checkout
	5) Finish
	6) OK (if applicable).
6) Open PHP Perspective. WSGreenways should be in the Project Explorer.
	-The php files that were located in the repository are now in the "reference/oldphp" directory of the project.
	-I've recreated a primitive form of the current WSGreenways mobile site in this project for reference.
		-You can open ref_oldsite_primitive/home.html in a browser
			-Right Click -> Properties; copy the path in location into a browser's address bar
	-All the contents of the zip file provided by Marcia Wilkinson are located under reference/ref_oldsite. PLEASE DON'T MODIFY anything in this folder.
	-The Java/JSP/SQL code from the site re-creation I created prior to receiving the zip file are also located under the reference directory
		
		
At this point, you should have the project and be able to view the primitive local version of the site.


Steps for modifying project:
1) Make changes in the various source files.
2) Right-click on WSGreenways (or any sub-file or directory) -> Team -> Synchronize with Repository.
3) Iterate through changes, preserving, discarding, or copying as necessary.
4) Right-click on WSGreenways (or applicable sub-file or directory) -> Team -> Commit
5) Select relevant files and directories.
6) Enter comment.
7) OK.

If you wish to discard all changes to a particular directory or file since the last checkout/commit, right-click -> Team -> Revert
		

IGNORE EVERYTHING PAST HERE. I will update it tonight (11/09/12)
Eventually, we'll probably implement actual code (way better than a lot of hard-coded HTML). When that happens, you'll need the following steps to run the application locally.
