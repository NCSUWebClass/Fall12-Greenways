1) Install Eclipse EE (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/junosr1)
2) Install Subclipse
	1) Open Eclipse
	2) Help -> Install New Software
	3) http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.8.x
	4) Check Subclipse
	5) Install (agree to license, etc.)
	6) Restart Eclipse
3) Setup repository location
	1) Window -> Open Perspective -> Other -> SVN Repository Exploring
	2) Under SVN Repositories at the top-left, Right-click -> New -> Repository Location
	3) Enter https://github.com/NCSUWebClass/Fall12-Greenways.git
	4) Finish
4) Checkout repository
	1) Open SVN Repository perspective.
	2) Under SVN Repositories, open ...github...Fall12-Greenways.git
	3) Right-click on trunk
	4) Checkout
	5) Finish
	6) OK (if applicable).
5) Open Java EE Perspective. WSGreenways should be in the Project Explorer.
	-Note: I copied this project from another project and left some temp files because GitHub doesn't like empty directories.
	-The php files that were located in the repository are now in the "php" directory of the project.
		-Eclipse doesn't seem to know what to do with PHP files (at least by default). You can open them by right-clicking -> Open With -> Text Editor
		-After the first time, double-clicking should work (for that file).
	-I've recreated the current WSGreenways mobile site in this project.
		-You can open WebRoot/home.html in a browser
			-Right Click -> Properties; copy the path in location into a browser's address bar
		
		
At this point, you should have the project and be able to view a local version of the site.


Steps for modifying project:
1) Make changes in the various source files.
2) Right-click on WSGreenways (or any sub-file or directory) -> Team -> Synchronize with Repository.
3) Iterate through changes, preserving, discarding, or copying as necessary.
4) Right-click on WSGreenways (or applicable sub-file or directory) -> Team -> Commit
5) Select relevant files and directories.
6) Enter comment.
7) OK.

If you wish to discard all changes to a particular directory or file since the last checkout/commit, right-click -> Team -> Revert
		
		
Eventually, we'll probably implement actual code (way better than a lot of hard-coded HTML). When that happens, you'll need the following steps to run the application locally.			
6) Install Tomcat server
	1) Go to http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi
	2) Select appropriate package under 7.0.32 -> Binary Distributions -> Core.
	3) Extract somewhere. Probably somewhere like C:\Program Files\Tomcat.
7) Setup Tomcat in Eclipse
	1) Open the Java EE perspective
	2) Open the Servers tab at the bottom.
	3) Right-click -> New -> Server
	4) Select Apacha -> Tomcat v7.0 Server
	5) Next.
	6) Browse to your Tomcat installation directory.
	7) Finish.
8) Add WSGreenways to Tomcat.
	1) Right-click on your Tomcat server.
	2) Add and remove.
	3) Select the greenways project fromt he left.
	4) Click Add>
	5) Finish.
	
To view the application locally:
9) Start Tomcat.
	1) Select Tomcat in the Servers tab.
	2) Press the "Start the Server" icon in the top-right corner of the window with the Servers tab.
		-Alternatively, type CTRL + ALT + R
10) Open a browser.
